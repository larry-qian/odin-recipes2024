        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 4255
            degrees Farenheit (220 degrees Celcius)</li>
            <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a
            saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for
            15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another
            saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and
            translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper,
            and celery seed.</li>
            <li>Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to
            10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust.
            Pour hot liquid mixture over top.</li>
            <li>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any
            excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to
            allow steam to escape</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown
            and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes
            before serving</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
