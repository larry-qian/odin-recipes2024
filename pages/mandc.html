            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring
                occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8
                minutes. (Look at direction 2 as well.)</li>
                <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium
                heat</li>
                <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about
                5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously.
                Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and
                bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't
                burn.</li>
                <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4
                minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until
                coated.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
