# odin-recipes2024 Repeat of the odin recipes, but maybe I can do better
with commits this time.

In this project, I will be using all of my knowledge with HTML,
including knowledge of tags, in order to create a website that
includes a recipe of a food I like to eat, including ingredient
step by step instructions, and even pictures of the finished
product as well.
